## The robustness of mental accounting: A global perspective

In this repository, we provide code and data to analyse the *Final* study described in Priolo et al. (2024): "The robustness of mental accounting: A global perspective". We also provide code and data to analyse the *Pilot* study and the codes to run the *Power Analysis* and the *Analysis Plan*.

## Demo
Click [here](https://run.pavlovia.org/simonedambrogio/mmar-demo/) to access a web-page that includes a demo with a small dataset that only includes the Plane study and the first three countries: Austria, Brazil, and Canada. Source code: Demo/index.qmd. You can execute it on your machine using the command ``` quarto render Demo/index.qmd ```. The file should be rendered in less than 5 minutes on a "normal" desktop computer.

## Analysis Study

Click [here](https://run.pavlovia.org/simonedambrogio/mmar-analysis/) to access a web-page that includes all the codes used to produce the results reported in the main text and in the supplementary materials are. 
Source code: Analysis Study/Analysis/index.qmd. You can execute it on your machine using the command ``` quarto render Analysis Study/Analysis/index.qmd ```. The file should be rendered in whithin 3 and 4 days on a "normal" desktop computer.
